My name is Alexander. I currently work at [CRAVE Metrics](http://www.cravemetrics.io). We're a small early-stage startup focusing on marketing analytics.

Before CRAVE, I worked on a small team at [Loop AI Labs](http://www.loop.ai) building neural networks for computer vision and NLP products.

Outside of work I like cooking, road cycling, and spending time with my SO.

Here's a picture of us from a trip to Italy in September 2018.

This is in the town of Varenna.
