My name is Alexander. 

I am a data scientist at [Mercury](http://www.mercury.com), a fintech company that provides modern banking solutions for everyday folks and businesses.

I enjoy solving challenging technical problems with pragmatic, iterative solutions.

Things outside of work that I'm slightly-above-average at:
- road and trail running

Things I'm below average at but have fun spending time trying to get better:
- chess (rapid, even worse at Blitz)
- poker (texas hold 'em)
