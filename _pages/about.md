My name is Alexander. 
I am a data scientist at [MOSAIC](http://www.joinmosaic.com), working toward 100% clean energy for all. 

Previously doing marketing analytics @ [CRAVE Metrics](http://www.cravemetrics.io) and building neural networks @ [Loop AI Labs](http://www.loop.ai).

Outside of work I like cooking, road cycling, and spending time with my SO.

Here's a picture of us from a trip to Italy in September 2018.

This is in the town of Varenna.
